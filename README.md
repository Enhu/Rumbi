# RumbiBot

A bot to provide needs for the Boop Troop server

# Usage

Clone the repository and make a JSON file called "appsettings" on the root folder, adding the following variables:

```
{
  "Token": "your-bot-token-goes-here",
  "TestGuildId": 1,
  "BoopTroopGuildId": 2

Change the respective variables with the actual Guild Ids and the bot Token.
